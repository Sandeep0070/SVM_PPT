# SVM_PPT

Support Vector Machines (SVM) are powerful machine learning algorithms used for classification and regression tasks, aiming to find an optimal hyperplane while maximizing the margin.
Linear SVM uses a hyperplane equation to separate classes, with the margin representing the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points.
SVM maximizes the margin while minimizing classification errors by formulating an optimization problem.
The kernel trick extends SVM to nonlinear classification by mapping data into higher-dimensional feature spaces and using kernel functions to compute inner products.
Soft margin SVM allows for misclassification by introducing slack variables, accommodating overlapping classes or noisy data.
SVM can be applied to regression tasks by finding a hyperplane that fits points within an Îµ-tube, with support vectors determining the regression line.
SVM is advantageous in high-dimensional spaces, handles both linear and nonlinear tasks, and is robust against overfitting with regularization parameters.
Tuning SVM parameters, such as C and gamma, is crucial to optimize its performance.
SVM finds applications in various domains, including image classification, text analysis, bioinformatics, and fraud detection.
In conclusion, SVM offers a versatile and powerful approach for classification and regression, combining mathematical optimization and the kernel trick to handle both linear and nonlinear data.
